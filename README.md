I enjoy building and helping others build things, both personally and professionally.

I've built big and small things at **Cloudflare**, **Microsoft** and **Amazon**.

Some of the more _interesting_ things I have built outside of work.

* A [custom language](https://github.com/jasoncabot/fabled-story-book/blob/main/internal/jabl/jabl.y) and [cross-platform interpreter](https://github.com/jasoncabot/fabled-story-book/blob/main/cmd/wasm/main.go) for writing [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) style books
* A [daily word game](https://linkagram.jasoncabot.me) with [streaks](https://github.com/jasoncabot/linkagram/blob/main/src/scenes/Linkagram.ts#L341-L345), [micropayments](https://github.com/jasoncabot/linkagram/tree/main/pay) and a [constraint solver](https://github.com/jasoncabot/linkagram/tree/main/solver)
* An [open-source](https://github.com/jasoncabot/wrath-of-toldir) 2D tile-based serverless 'MM'ORPG [playable in a browser](https://wot.jasoncabot.com)
* An [old turn-based strategy game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen_Haven) for [the web](https://github.com/jasoncabot/fallen)
* A multiplayer, online version of the [Triple Triad Card Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Triad) for [the web](https://ttelements.com)

... and **lots** more
